# Automatic Speech Recognition Project
This project presents the implementation and testing of multiple models for the prediction of English phonetic sequences on the TIMIT dataset. The primary objective of the project is to apply machine learning techniques to accurately and automatically output a sequence of English phonemes -- the building blocks of how a word is pronounced -- from an input audio wav file. Thereafter, different model architectures were explored and tests conducted to assess the effectiveness of the model, while tweaks of hyperparameters were also done to observe their effect on performance.
